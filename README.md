## Website I find interesting
[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is probably the most beginner-friendly website I have come across for anyone interested in web development. freeCodeCamp is a non profit learning platform that consists of interactive classes, in web development, online forum and chat rooms.
They currently have also 7000 tutorials from beginner HTML, CSS and JavaScript to projects that the learners can complete on their own or with friends. The best part of it all is that it is free.
