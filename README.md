## Website I find interesting
[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is probably the most beginner-friendly website I have come across for anyone interested in web development. freeCodeCamp is a non profit learning platform that consists of interactive classes, in web development, online forum and chat rooms.
They currently have also 7000 tutorials from beginner HTML, CSS and JavaScript to projects that the learners can complete on their own or with friends. The best part of it all is that it is free.

FreeCodeCamp is definitely the right place to get familiar with HTML,CSS and JavaScript since the courses are free. Also , I believe you get a certification of completion at the end of each completed course which is amazing. I definitely recommend FreeCodeCamp to all.
